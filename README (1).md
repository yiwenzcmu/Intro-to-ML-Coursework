# CMU 10601 Introduction to Machine Learning Coursework

This repository contains programming assignments from the CMU course 10601. The assignments focus on implementing machine learning algorithms from scratch using only the NumPy library in Python. The topics covered include decision tree learning, logistic regression, neural networks, hidden Markov models, and reinforcement learning. The assignments provide hands-on experience in implementing these algorithms and gaining a deeper understanding of their inner workings.

## Course Description

 
This course covers the theory and practical algorithms for machine learning from a variety of perspectives. We cover topics such as decision tree learning, neural networks, statistical learning methods, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. 

The course covers theoretical concepts such as inductive bias, the PAC learning framework, Bayesian learning methods, and Occamâ€™s Razor. Programming assignments include hands-on experiments with various learning algorithms. 

This course is designed to give a graduate-level student a thorough grounding in the methodologies, technologies, mathematics and algorithms currently needed by people who do research in machine learning.
